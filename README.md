**Dining Philosophers Problem**
This repository contains a C implementation of the Dining Philosophers Problem. This problem is a classic concurrency challenge in computer science that demonstrates how to manage shared resources (in this case, forks) between multiple processes (philosophers) without causing deadlock or resource contention.

Program Overview
The project consists of:

A mandatory program (philo) that meets the basic requirements.
An optional bonus program if additional features are implemented.
Both versions follow the rules below:

Rules & Specifications
No Global Variables: All data, including philosopher states and forks, is encapsulated within structures.
Arguments:
number_of_philosophers: Number of philosophers and forks (1 per philosopher).
time_to_die: Maximum time in milliseconds a philosopher can go without eating before dying.
time_to_eat: Time in milliseconds each philosopher spends eating.
time_to_sleep: Time in milliseconds each philosopher spends sleeping.
[number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat] (optional): If provided, the simulation stops after each philosopher has eaten this number of times. If omitted, the simulation only stops upon a philosopherâ€™s death.
Behavior
Philosopher Lifecycle: Each philosopher is represented by a thread that goes through the states of thinking, eating, and sleeping in cycles.
Forks: Philosophers pick up two forks (mutexes) to eat, with one fork between each pair of philosophers.
Logging: The program logs state changes for each philosopher in the format:
csharp

timestamp_in_ms X has taken a fork
timestamp_in_ms X is eating
timestamp_in_ms X is sleeping
timestamp_in_ms X is thinking
timestamp_in_ms X died
timestamp_in_ms: Time in milliseconds since the start of the simulation.
X: Philosopher number (1 through number_of_philosophers).

No Message Mixing: Each message is displayed separately to avoid mixing.
Timeliness: A philosopher's death message is displayed within 10 ms of their actual death.
Threading & Synchronization
Each philosopher is a thread, and each fork is protected by a mutex.
The solution ensures no data races and synchronizes state updates to prevent simultaneous message output.

Compilation and Execution
Makefile Targets:
all: Compiles the program.
clean: Removes object files.
fclean: Removes all compiled files.
re: Recompiles the program.
Example Usage
bash
./philo number_of_philosophers time_to_die time_to_eat time_to_sleep [number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat]
Example:

bash
./philo 5 800 200 200
This command runs a simulation with 5 philosophers, where each has 800 ms to eat before dying, spends 200 ms eating, and 200 ms sleeping. The program stops when a philosopher dies, as no specific meal count is given.

External Functions
The following external functions are allowed:

memset, printf, malloc, free, write, usleep, gettimeofday
pthread_create, pthread_detach, pthread_join, pthread_mutex_init
pthread_mutex_destroy, pthread_mutex_lock, pthread_mutex_unlock
Important Notes
Libft is not allowed.
Concurrency & Deadlock Prevention: Philosophers should avoid deadlocks and prevent starvation by managing fork access properly.
