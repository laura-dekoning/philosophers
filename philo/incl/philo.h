/*Philosopher number 1 sits next to philosopher number 
number_of_philosophers.
Any other philosopher number N sits between philosopher number N - 1 and 
philosopher number N + 1*/

/*About the logs of your program:
• Any state change of a philosopher must be formatted as follows:
◦ timestamp_in_ms X has taken a fork
◦ timestamp_in_ms X is eating
◦ timestamp_in_ms X is sleeping
◦ timestamp_in_ms X is thinking
◦ timestamp_in_ms X died
Replace timestamp_in_ms with the current timestamp in milliseconds
and X with the philosopher number.
• A displayed state message should not be mixed up with another message.
• A message announcing a philosopher died should be displayed no more than 10 ms
after the actual death of the philosopher.
• Again, philosophers should avoid dying!*/

/*The specific rules for the mandatory part are:
• Each philosopher should be a thread.
• There is one fork between each pair of philosophers. Therefore, if there are several
philosophers, each philosopher has a fork on their left side and a fork on their right
side. If there is only one philosopher, there should be only one fork on the table.
• To prevent philosophers from duplicating forks, you should protect the forks state
with a mutex for each of them.*/
