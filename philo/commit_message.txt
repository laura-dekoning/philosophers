Refactor error handling and mutex usage, rename functions and enums

- Updated `Makefile`: renamed `ft_atol` to `ft_atoul`.
- Refactored error handling in `ft_error.c`: replaced integer flags with error messages.
- Adjusted `init.c` and `parser.c`: migrated to `ft_atoul` for safer parsing, added better handling of return values.
- Modified `structs.h`: removed `t_fork` struct, now using `pthread_mutex_t *forks`, renamed fork pointers in `s_philo`.
- Renamed `ft_atol.c` to `ft_atoul.c`, updated function to use `unsigned long`.
  
Known issues:
- `init_table` function returns need consistent error handling (especially for pthread joins).
- Review how errors are freed or cleaned in failure paths.
- Ensure all mutex initializations are checked and freed if they fail.
  
General refactoring and cleanup, but needs further testing for edge cases and error consistency.
