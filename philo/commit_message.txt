refactor: update Makefile and error handling, rename functions

- Added `-pthread` flag to `Makefile` for thread handling.
- Renamed `error_msg.c` to `error_exit.c` for better clarity.
- Replaced `ft_atoi` with `ft_atol` for handling larger values.
- Refactored data initialization and validation in `init_data.c`.
- Added `parser.c` to handle input parsing and validation.
